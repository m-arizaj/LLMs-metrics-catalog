While simplicity is its main strength, accuracy can also be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the others.

These biases include stereotypes, misrepresentations, and derogatory language that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The goal of fairness evaluation is to measure these harms to understand and prevent the propagation of bias. In the context of LLMs, fairness is often operationalized into two main concepts: Group Fairness: Requires that a statistical outcome measure (like accuracy or toxicity score) has approximate parity across different social groups.

Introduced by Rohrbach et al. (2018) in Object Hallucination in Image Captioning (EMNLP 2018), it evaluates the alignment between generated captions and ground-truth visual object annotations, thus measuring how faithful the description is to the image content. Unlike traditional captioning metrics such as CIDEr or SPICE, which only assess textual similarity to reference captions, CHAIR measures the semantic accuracy of image grounding. In 2024, the AMBER benchmark (Wang et al., 2024) extended CHAIR as part of a multi-dimensional hallucination evaluation suite for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), integrating it into the AMBER Score for combined generative and discriminative assessment.","s":"Introduction","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/semantic/chair","h":"#introduction","p":2038},{"i":2042,"t":"CHAIR has two primary variants: CHAIRi=∣H∣∣M∣CHAIR_i = \\frac{|H|}{|M|}CHAIRs=∣SH∣∣S∣CHAIR_s = \\frac{|S_H|}{|S|} Where: ∣H∣|H| = number of hallucinated objects (mentioned but not present). ∣M∣|M| = total number of objects mentioned in the caption. ∣SH∣|S_H| = number of sentences containing at least one hallucinated object. ∣S∣|S| = total number of generated sentences.

(2018) also introduced image consistency and language consistency analyses, showing that models with higher hallucination rates produce predictions more aligned with their language model than with visual evidence. The metric was later generalized in AMBER to quantify hallucinations of: Existence (missing/spurious objects) Attribute (incorrect states, numbers, or actions) Relation (incorrect spatial or interaction relations) CHAIR quantifies faithfulness, not fluency. It serves as a critical complement to text-based metrics (CIDEr, SPICE, METEOR), allowing researchers to evaluate visual hallucinations and semantic grounding simultaneously.

Unlike Pearson’s r, it does not assume linearity, normality, or equal variances, making it suitable for ordinal data and non-linear relationships. In software engineering and LLM evaluation, Spearman’s ρ is widely used to measure how consistently automatic metrics rank model outputs compared with human judgments. A high ρ value indicates that two rankings (e.g., human preference vs. metric-based ordering) follow the same relative order.","s":"Introduction","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/statistical/spearman","h":"#introduction","p":2404},{"i":2408,"t":"For data without significant ties, Spearman’s ρ is computed as: ρ=1−6∑i=1ndi2n(n2−1)\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)} Where: did_i is the rank difference of the ii-th pair, nn is the number of paired observations. When ties are present, Spearman’s ρ is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the rank-transformed variables: ρ=cov(rgX, rgY)σrgX σrgY\\rho = \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(rg_X,\\, rg_Y)}{\\sigma_{rg_X}\\,\\sigma_{rg_Y}} This formulation, also discussed in Xu et al.

Within the broader SE literature (e.g., references 11, 12, 24, 37, 40 in the dataset), it is applied to: Human–metric correlation: Measuring how well a metric’s rankings of generated code or summaries align with human preferences. Metric comparison: Comparing the ordering induced by metrics such as BLEU, CodeBLEU, or Pass@k against human correctness ratings. Benchmark-level ranking stability: Evaluating whether different metrics rank LLMs consistently across tasks such as code generation, summarization, and explanation. Although the Xu et al. (2010) paper focuses on theoretical properties of correlation coefficients, Spearman’s ρ is frequently adopted in SE evaluation settings for its robustness to non-linear relationships between predicted metric scores and human judgments.","s":"Applications in Software Engineering","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/statistical/spearman","h":"#applications-in-software-engineering","p":2404},{"i":2414,"t":"For software engineering evaluation: ρ close to +1: Strong positive monotonic relationship — metric and human rankings agree. ρ around 0: No monotonic relationship — rankings are unrelated. ρ close to –1: Strong negative monotonic relationship — rankings move in opposite directions.
