While simplicity is its main strength, accuracy can also be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the others.

The Vendi Score is a \"reference-free\" metric, meaning it does not require a set of real images for comparison. Instead, it quantifies diversity by calculating the \"effective number of unique samples\" within a given set of generated images. A higher Vendi Score indicates greater diversity. The metric is particularly useful for analyzing class-conditional models, where a key challenge is balancing inter-class diversity (generating all classes) with intra-class diversity (generating variety within a single class).

The metric follows a two-step process: Feature Extraction: Samples from both the real and generated datasets are passed through a feature extractor (an \"encoder\") to get lower-dimensional representations. Distance Calculation: The Fréchet distance (also known as the Wasserstein-2 distance) is calculated between two multivariate Gaussian distributions that are fitted to the mean and covariance of these extracted features. This metric is most commonly known as FID (Fréchet Inception Distance), which specifically refers to using the Inception-V3 network as the feature extractor. While FID is a standard, it is known to have flaws, such as a poor correlation with human perception of realism and biases from its encoder. This has led to the development of variants like FD∞ (to correct for sample bias) and the use of FD with alternative encoders (like DINOv2).","s":"Introduction","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/generative/fd","h":"#introduction","p":1272},{"i":1277,"t":"The standard Fréchet Distance.

In software engineering and LLM evaluation, Spearman’s ρ is widely used to measure how consistently automatic metrics rank model outputs compared with human judgments. A high ρ value indicates that two rankings (e.g., human preference vs. metric-based ordering) follow the same relative order.","s":"Introduction","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/statistical/spearman","h":"#introduction","p":2387},{"i":2391,"t":"For data without significant ties, Spearman’s ρ is computed as: ρ=1−6∑i=1ndi2n(n2−1)\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)} Where: did_i is the rank difference of the ii-th pair, nn is the number of paired observations. When ties are present, Spearman’s ρ is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the rank-transformed variables: ρ=cov(rgX, rgY)σrgX σrgY\\rho = \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(rg_X,\\, rg_Y)}{\\sigma_{rg_X}\\,\\sigma_{rg_Y}} This formulation, also discussed in Xu et al. (2010), generalizes Spearman’s ρ to datasets where ranks are not strictly unique.","s":"Formula","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/statistical/spearman","h":"#formula","p":2387},{"i":2393,"t":"Spearman’s rₛ: Traditional notation for the coefficient based on ranked data.

Within the broader SE literature (e.g., references 11, 12, 24, 37, 40 in the dataset), it is applied to: Human–metric correlation: Measuring how well a metric’s rankings of generated code or summaries align with human preferences. Metric comparison: Comparing the ordering induced by metrics such as BLEU, CodeBLEU, or Pass@k against human correctness ratings. Benchmark-level ranking stability: Evaluating whether different metrics rank LLMs consistently across tasks such as code generation, summarization, and explanation. Although the Xu et al. (2010) paper focuses on theoretical properties of correlation coefficients, Spearman’s ρ is frequently adopted in SE evaluation settings for its robustness to non-linear relationships between predicted metric scores and human judgments.","s":"Applications in Software Engineering","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/statistical/spearman","h":"#applications-in-software-engineering","p":2387},{"i":2397,"t":"For software engineering evaluation: ρ close to +1: Strong positive monotonic relationship — metric and human rankings agree. ρ around 0: No monotonic relationship — rankings are unrelated. ρ close to –1: Strong negative monotonic relationship — rankings move in opposite directions. Because it does not assume linearity, Spearman’s ρ is often preferred over Pearson’s r when dealing with ordinal human ratings, non-linear relationships between metric scores and correctness, or heterogeneous metric scales.","s":"Interpretation","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/statistical/spearman","h":"#interpretation","p":2387},{"i":2399,"t":"Xu, W., Hou, Y., Hung, Y.
