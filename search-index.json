While simplicity is its main strength, accuracy can also be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the others.

When the majority of cases are non-defective, optimizing recall ensures that minority (defective) cases are not ignored — an insight that translates directly to LLM evaluations where rare but critical cases (e.g., security vulnerabilities or logical failures) exist. Wattanakriengkrai et al. (2020) extend this perspective by applying recall to line-level code defect prediction, demonstrating that a higher recall reflects a model’s capacity to detect all potentially defective lines. This parallels LLM-based code generation or repair tasks, where missing a single error can compromise functional correctness. Díaz, Ekstrand & Mitra (2023) discuss recall from a broader evaluation theory perspective, connecting it to robustness and lexicographic evaluation in large-scale model assessment.

These biases include stereotypes, misrepresentations, and derogatory language that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The goal of fairness evaluation is to measure these harms to understand and prevent the propagation of bias. In the context of LLMs, fairness is often operationalized into two main concepts: Group Fairness: Requires that a statistical outcome measure (like accuracy or toxicity score) has approximate parity across different social groups.

Examples: WEAT (Word Embedding Association Test), SEAT (Sentence Encoder Association Test). Probability-Based Metrics: What they do: Use the model-assigned token probabilities to estimate bias. This is often done by comparing the likelihood of \"counterfactual\" sentences that are identical except for a perturbed social group attribute (e.g., \"The man was a nurse\" vs. \"The woman was a nurse\"). Examples: CrowS-Pairs Score, DisCo, Log-Probability Bias Score. Generated Text-Based Metrics: What they do: Analyze the final free-text output generated by the model in response to a prompt. This includes: Distribution: Comparing co-occurrence counts of group terms with neutral or stereotypical words. Metrics like Demographic Representation and Stereotypical Associations fall here.
