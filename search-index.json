Its primary advantages include: Contextual comprehension: Goes beyond literal matching by analyzing token meaning in context, crucial for tasks like code summarization or translation. Tolerance to variation: Robust to stylistic or lexical changes that don’t affect functionality (e.g., variable renaming or reordering). High correlation with human evaluation: Especially for code generation tasks when paired with CodeBERT or LLM-based embeddings. However, BERTScore also has limitations: It can inflate scores for semantically incorrect but lexically similar code. It depends on the pretraining corpus of the chosen embedding model (e.g., BERT, CodeBERT, or GPT-based encoders). It is computationally heavier than token-based alternatives. In practice, BERTScore and CodeBERTScore are most effective when combined with execution-based metrics (like Pass@k or Test Pass Rate), providing a more holistic view of both semantic and functional model performance.","s":"Interpretation","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/accuracy-overlap/bertscore","h":"#interpretation","p":44},{"i":63,"t":"Zhang, T., Kishore, V., Wu, F., Weinberger, K.

Tantithamthavorn et al. (2018) emphasize that recall is highly sensitive to class imbalance, a common issue in defect prediction datasets. When the majority of cases are non-defective, optimizing recall ensures that minority (defective) cases are not ignored — an insight that translates directly to LLM evaluations where rare but critical cases (e.g., security vulnerabilities or logical failures) exist. Wattanakriengkrai et al. (2020) extend this perspective by applying recall to line-level code defect prediction, demonstrating that a higher recall reflects a model’s capacity to detect all potentially defective lines. This parallels LLM-based code generation or repair tasks, where missing a single error can compromise functional correctness. Díaz, Ekstrand & Mitra (2023) discuss recall from a broader evaluation theory perspective, connecting it to robustness and lexicographic evaluation in large-scale model assessment.

In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Software Engineering (SE), toxicity metrics are vital for assessing the safety and ethical reliability of generated code comments, commit messages, documentation, or natural language outputs in development workflows. Traditional approaches (such as RealToxicityPrompts or ToxiGen) rely on reference datasets with labeled toxic and non-toxic examples, while recent frameworks like LATTE (Koh et al., 2024) integrate LLM-based evaluators that contextualize toxicity across categories like demeaning, biased, and harmful content.
