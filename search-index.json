Its primary objective is to offer a unified reference that enables researchers, practitioners, and students to: Understand how LLMs are evaluated in software engineering contexts. Compare evaluation dimensions across studies. Identify gaps, biases, and methodological limitations in current assessment practices.

Instead of presenting metrics in isolation, the catalog organizes them into coherent conceptual categories that reflect the nature of the evaluation, such as performance, structural quality, semantic fidelity, reasoning, robustness, human judgment, or system-level properties. Ultimately, this work seeks to: Facilitate metric selection for academic and industrial studies. Promote methodological clarity for future research. Provide a reproducible and extensible framework for analyzing metric usage trends.

These categories reflect what aspect of model behavior is being evaluated, ensuring conceptual clarity and usability. A brief overview of each folder’s nature and conceptual scope is as follows: Core Accuracy & Overlap Metrics Focuses on direct comparisons between model outputs and reference solutions, emphasizing correctness and matching behavior. Statistical & Correlation Metrics Includes metrics that analyze statistical relationships, score consistency, or agreement between model outputs and human or model-based benchmarks. Code Quality & Structural Metrics Captures structural, stylistic, or syntactic properties of generated code, emphasizing maintainability, complexity, and structural coherence. Functional & Test-based Evaluation Measures behavioral correctness through execution, test-case validation, or functional performance. Human & Subjective Evaluation Covers assessments relying on human judgment, including perceived quality, helpfulness, fairness, readability, or relevance. Generative & Distribution Metrics Examines alignment between generated outputs and target data distributions, including coverage, diversity, and realism of generative behavior. Logical Reasoning & Verification Focuses on model reasoning ability, formal verification, logical consistency, and equivalence under transformations. Robustness, Security & Reliability Evaluates stability under perturbations, vulnerability to attacks, security properties, and failure modes. Efficiency & Resource Usage Addresses runtime performance, memory consumption, latency, and overall computational efficiency. Architectural & System-level Metrics Investigates system-wide characteristics, architectural behavior, and high-level performance across integrated SE workflows. Creativity, Diversity & Novelty Encompasses originality, diversity, innovation, and the degree to which outputs differ meaningfully from existing data. Ranking, Reward & Optimization Includes preference modeling, evaluation-by-ranking, reinforcement-derived scoring, and optimization-based assessments. Semantic, Coherence & Hallucination Metrics Focuses on semantic fidelity, truthfulness, factual grounding, consistency, and the presence or absence of hallucinations. Each folder contains conceptual explanations, definitions, contextual usage notes, and references to the original sources where the metrics in that category were proposed or applied.","s":"Classification Framework","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/intro","h":"#classification-framework","p":1},{"i":10,"t":"This project and its written content are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

It measures the proportion of correct predictions or outputs relative to the total number of evaluated instances. In its most basic form, accuracy is used to quantify how often a model produces the expected or correct result, providing an intuitive sense of overall performance. While simplicity is its main strength, accuracy can also be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the others.

In LLM and software engineering evaluation, these metrics serve as general-purpose indicators of both accuracy and reliability in generated artifacts or agentic workflows. Because rates are normalized (ranging from 0 to 1, or 0–100%), they allow direct comparisons across tasks, datasets, and experimental setups.","s":"Introduction","u":"/LLMs-metrics-catalog/metrics/statistical/rate","h":"#introduction","p":2392},{"i":2396,"t":"The general formulation for a rate metric is: Rate=Nsuccessful outcomesNtotal outcomes\\text{Rate} = \\frac{N_{\\text{successful outcomes}}}{N_{\\text{total outcomes}}} where: Nsuccessful outcomesN_{\\text{successful outcomes}} is the count of outputs meeting a given criterion (e.g., passing all tests, producing valid code, completing a task).
