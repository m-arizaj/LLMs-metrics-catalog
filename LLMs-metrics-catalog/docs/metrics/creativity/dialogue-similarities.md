## Introduction

"Dialogue Similarities" is a type of **Human Similarity metric** used in the objective evaluation of LLM-based autonomous agents. This metric is designed to quantify the degree to which an agent's behavior, specifically its conversational output, "closely resembles that of humans".

It is an objective, quantitative metric  often grouped with other human similarity metrics—such as "trajectory/location accuracy" and "mimicry of human responses"—to assess an agent's performance in simulating human behavior.

## 1. Dialogue Similarities

### Definition

"Dialogue Similarities" is an objective metric used to evaluate LLM-based autonomous agents. It falls under the category of **Human Similarity metrics**, which are formally defined as metrics that "quantify the degree to which the agent behaviors closely resembles that of humans". It is specifically cited as a "Typical example" of such a metric.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of measuring dialogue similarities is to assess the agent's "human simulation performance". A high score in dialogue similarity indicates that the agent is effective at mimicking human-like conversational behavior.

### Applications

This metric is used in the objective evaluation of autonomous agents, particularly in protocols involving **Social evaluation**  or "human simulation".

### Limitations

As a form of objective evaluation, "Dialogue Similarities" provides quantitative insights but may not "perfectly measure all types of agent capabilities". Such objective metrics are considered essential complements to subjective assessment.
