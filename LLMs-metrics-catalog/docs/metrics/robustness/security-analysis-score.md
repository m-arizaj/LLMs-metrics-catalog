## Definition

The **Security Analysis Score (SAS)** is a metric used to evaluate the security posture of code, typically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). It provides a quantitative vulnerability assessment based on established industry frameworks, most notably the **OWASP Top 10** (Open Web Application Security Project), and is implemented using static analysis techniques.

The score specifically evaluates the presence or absence of common, critical security issues, such as:
* SQL Injection
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Buffer Overflows
* Insecure Cryptographic Practices

***

## Calculation (General Idea)

Unlike metrics with a simple mathematical formula, the SAS is typically derived from the output of Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools.

The calculation is generally based on the **identification, count, and classification** of vulnerabilities found in the code. A higher score indicates fewer or less severe vulnerabilities, while a lower score indicates significant security risks. It is a key component of the **Code Quality Assessment** dimension in modern software engineering benchmarks.

***

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the SAS is to move evaluation beyond mere functional correctness and assess the **safety and robustness** of generated code. It quantifies a model's ability to produce code that is not only functional but also secure against common attack vectors, which is a critical aspect of real-world software engineering.

## Domains

* Software Engineering
* Long-Context Code Evaluation
* Code Quality Assessment 
* Security Vulnerability Assessment 

***

## Advantages

* **Real-World Relevance:** Measures a critical aspect of code quality (security) that is often overlooked by metrics focused only on functional correctness or textual similarity.
* **Standardized:** By basing the assessment on industry-standard frameworks like OWASP, the metric provides a well-understood and widely accepted basis for evaluation.
* **Actionable:** Provides specific feedback on security flaws (e.g., "SQL injection found"), which is more actionable for model improvement than a simple pass/fail score.

***

## Limitations

* **Tool-Dependent:** The score's accuracy and comprehensiveness are highly dependent on the underlying static analysis tools used for detection.
* **Potential for False Positives/Negatives:** Static analysis is known for sometimes misidentifying issues (false positives) or, more commonly, missing complex, logic-based vulnerabilities that require dynamic execution to detect.
* **Scope:** Primarily focused on *common* vulnerabilities (like those in the OWASP Top 10) and may not cover novel or highly domain-specific security flaws.
