## Definition

The **System Thinking Score (STS)** is a metric used within the LoCoBench benchmark to evaluate a Large Language Model's (LLM) sophisticated software engineering capabilities

It is specifically adapted from systems engineering assessment frameworks (Blanchard and Fabrycky, 2016) The metric assesses the model's holistic understanding of the software system and its awareness of scalability

STS is one of eight metrics that contribute to the "Software Engineering Excellence" dimension of the LoCoBench Score (LCBS)

***

## Purpose

The purpose of the System Thinking Score is to measure an LLM's ability to go beyond simple code generation and demonstrate a deeper, holistic comprehension of the entire software system. This includes its ability to understand complex system designs, component relationships, and the implications of scalability

***

## Domains

* Long-Context LLM Evaluation
* Software Engineering Excellence

***


## Advantages

* **Holistic Evaluation:** Unlike metrics focused on single functions, STS assesses a model's understanding of the entire system architecture
* **Measures Advanced Skills:** It specifically targets sophisticated software engineering capabilities, such as understanding scalability, which are essential for complex, real-world development

***

## Limitations

* **Benchmark-Specific:** This metric is defined as part of the LoCoBench framework and relies on its specific tasks and scoring
* **Dependence on Frameworks:** Its definition is adapted from existing systems engineering frameworks (Blanchard and Fabrycky, 2016), rather than being a standalone, universally computed formula
